# Custom Case for FG542-FG543-FG742-NM-C101
After getting a new laptop, I decided to use my old Lenovo laptop as a server.
The old case takes up quite a lot of space, so I decided to make a custom one.


Measurements for the actual board and included parts (such as the fan or heatsink) are not publicly available,
so all measurements were taken by me, using vernier calipers, a measuring tape and online patents for some parts that have public patents (such as [USB Connectors](https://www.usb.org/)).


> [!WARNING]
> The case model is currently in an unfinished state. I advice against using this model as-is unless you want to keep track of progress.
